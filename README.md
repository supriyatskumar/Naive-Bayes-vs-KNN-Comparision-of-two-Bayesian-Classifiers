# Naive-Bayes-vs-KNN-Comparision-of-two-Bayesian-Classifiers

Two different Bayesian classifiers are trained to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. 
The dataset consists of several medical predictor variables and one target label, "Outcome". Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.
